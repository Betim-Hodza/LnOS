# Things to do

- [ ] Gather poll data
- [ ] Make arch installer into a tui (gum ?)
- [X] Make LnOs-automatic-setup into tui
- [ ] LnOs-auto-script needs:
* ask what Desktop environment the user wants
    * if they want dotfiles for that environment (if applicable)
* What type of student they are (e.g. CSE, Mechanical etc.)
    * when this action happens it opens a drop down menu with selections on the tools that would be installed (e.g. git, gcc, brave, etc.)
- [ ] integrate installer and setup scripts into archiso and publish that as our version (research on this)
